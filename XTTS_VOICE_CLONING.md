## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Voice Cloning Fails**
- Check reference audio format (WAV recommended)
- Ensure audio is at least 3 seconds long
- Verify audio quality with analysis tool
- Check available system memory

**Poor Quality Output**
- Analyze reference audio quality
- Try voice optimization
- Reduce background noise in reference
- Use longer reference audio (6+ seconds)

**Model Loading Errors**
- Check internet connection for model download

- Clear TTS cache if corrupted
- Update TTS library version

### Performance Issues

**Slow Generation**
- Enable GPU acceleration
- Use CPU optimization flags
- Reduce text length per generation
- Close unnecessary applications

**Memory Errors**
